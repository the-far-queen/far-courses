"""Transmission — can the schools carry the Tier 2 content to a newcomer?

Written 2026-10-09 after Bobby's question about the domain set and the
seership as capstone. If seership is a skill rather than a mystical gift,
then in principle the curriculum is a transmission path. That claim is
testable in one direction immediately, and this module is that test:

    if the schools cannot carry the formal (Tier 2) content to someone
    who has never met this project, the transmission fails, and every
    other argument in the curriculum is decoration.

WHAT IS MEASURED. For a body of text, the ratio of content a reader must
already know in order to read it. Concretely:

  PREREQUISITE LOAD  the fraction of domain terms used without definition
  SELF-CONTAINMENT  the fraction of content carrying its own definitions
  GLOSSARY COVER    of used terms, how many are defined somewhere in the corpus

This is not a proxy for comprehension and does not claim to be. It is a
floor: a text that fails this cannot be read by a newcomer at all, whatever
the author's intent.

WHY IT MATTERS HERE. far-courses, far-writing, far-math and the rest are
the medium the curriculum travels in. If they only work for people already
inside the project, the "free schools without a price" framing is a
distribution claim rather than a transmission claim, and those are very
different things to have built.
