"""Curriculum gate — which domains are actually part of the school.

Written 2026-10-09 after Bobby's question about the domain set for the
seership. The prose answer is in
`vault/20-writing/notes/curriculum-for-seership-2026-10-09.md`. This file
is the same list in a form that can REJECT a domain, because a curriculum
that can only add is a reading list.

THE GATE, in order:

  1. TRANSMISSIBLE  can a document be written that gets under 50%
     prerequisite load, for a reader who has never met this project
  2. CHECKABLE      is there a test that can go red
  3. DECISION-CHANGING  does it change a decision somewhere, or is it
     context for its own sake

A domain that fails (3) is not wrong. It is a LIBRARY rather than a
SCHOOL, and libraries belong in far-mysteries, ungated. That distinction
is the load-bearing idea in this file: the same material can be either,
and the difference is whether it changes what someone does next.

`assess()` returns the verdict per domain. `gate()` returns only the
domains that pass all three, which is the smallest defensible curriculum.
